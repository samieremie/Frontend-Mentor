## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned about CSS units:

- The difference between absolute and relative units.
- The most used relative units: em, rem, %, vh, vw and ch.

This allowed me to create a design that will scale up with the browser settings of users.

I also made sure that the component fits into different screen sizes and still renders correctly (in the middle of the screen).
